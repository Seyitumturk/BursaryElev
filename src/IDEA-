 TINDER STYLE MATCHING UI - THIS WILL SERVE AS A SEPERATE SERVICE - WITH DIFFERENT RULES BUT WILL COMPLETELY BE OPTIONAL. THE GROUNDS OF THIS UI WILL DIFFER, AS STUDENTS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO WRITE AND PRODUCE. 

 GAMIFICATION BY INCENTIVISING WRITING BETTER BURSARIES- ELEV TEAM WILL ANLAYZZE YOUR WRITINGS AND WILL GIVE THEM A SCORE, ALONG WITH YOUR PROFILE, THE MORE SCORE YOU HAVE THE HIGHER CHANCES YOU WILL HAVE TO GET A MATCH.
 
 THINGS LIKE INCREASE VISIBILITY BY ADDING A NEW ESSAY ..

FOR EACH BURSARY LISTING - ADD WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO SUCCEED AND ADD A DETAILED ROADMAP TO GET STUDNETS STARTED. 

Claude will aggreagite student profile semantic and will do the match rating - then we will display on hover on the suggested bursaires why it matched this bursary in a very intutitve way - with match level like normal , good , best fit and more conversational style details as to why.
